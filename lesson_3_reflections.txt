When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

  A remote repository is useful when you're working with more people, it also works as 
  an external backup in case a disaster happens.
  The third reason to use a remote repository is to make it public so other people can
  use this project (or to boost your ego)

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically 
stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

  Maybe that would be OK if every local work is done on branches and no one else works
  on those branches, but that isn't too realistic. The fact is that if there are changes
  that are pulled automatically it can generate a stream of merge conflicts and even
  unexpected changes to the current code base, so we would be wasting lots of time in
  order to get back to a working state.
